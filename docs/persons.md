This curated dataset is derived from the persons authority file of the Estonian National Bibliography (ENB), a comprehensive catalog of publications written in Estonian, published in Estonia, or focusing on Estonian culture and people. Designed for computational analysis, this dataset adapts the original authority file for research and cultural exploration. Through a systematic process of filtering, cleaning, and harmonizing, the ENB dataset is presented in a streamlined tabular format that retains rich metadata while improving accessibility. Fields selected for inclusion are harmonized and, where possible, linked to external sources, offering an optimized and reproducible resource for historical, cultural, and bibliographic research.
